### System Requirements
- [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/en) or later.
- macOS, Windows (with WSL), and Linux are supported.

  To understand the installation processes of NextJS, you can view their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation)

### Automatic installation

To deploy with [SST](https://sst.dev/) on Windows, you have to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install "Instructions"). If you prefer to use a different deployment option, you can ignore the steps involving WSL and clone the project on your machine directly.

<Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS / Linux"]}>

<Tab value="Windows">
<Callout title="Note">
  If you decide to deploy with something other than SST, you must delete all
  related components and uninstall everything related to SST before running `npm install` otherwise the project will not run on Windows.
</Callout>

For Windows use, you must use WSL with the **Ubuntu** distribution.

```shell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
wsl --set-default Ubuntu
```

Set the default user to **root**

```shell
wsl.exe
nano /etc/wsl.conf
```

`/etc/wsl.conf`

```
[boot]
systemd=true
[user]
default=root
```

Use this command to restart WSL with your new changes

```shell
wsl.exe --shutdown
```

Now you must create a new directory to store the project (outside of /mnt/c, hence needing default root access).

```shell
wsl.exe
mkdir /development
cd /development
```

You can now clone the project with `git clone`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Readtt/corex.git
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="macOS / Linux">
  [SST CLI](https://sst.dev/docs/reference/cli/) has full support with macOS and Linux. 
  
  ```shell 
  git clone https://github.com/Readtt/corex.git 
  ```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Install global CLI tools
<Tabs items={["Windows", "macOS / Linux"]}>

<Tab value="Windows">
For Windows use, you must install all CLI tools using WSL.

1. Install the [Stripe CLI with apt](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli?install-method=apt)
2. Authenticate with `stripe login`
3. (Optional) Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
</Tab>

<Tab value="macOS / Linux">
For macOS and Linux use, install all CLI tools normally.

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)
2. Authenticate with `stripe login`
3. (Optional) Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Setting up environment variables
```shell
# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# Get the Database URL from your preferred database. 
DATABASE_URL='mysql://YOUR_MYSQL_URL_HERE?sslaccept=strict'

# Authentication
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID='<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>'
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET='<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>'

# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:
# openssl rand -base64 32
# https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret
AUTH_SECRET='<AUTH_SECRET>'
AUTH_TRUST_HOST='http://localhost:3000'

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='pk_12345'
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY='sk_12345'
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET='<STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET>'

# SST
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>'
```
- `DATABASE_URL` is the URL Prisma uses to connect to your database (default is postgres)
  - My recommendation is to try using [railway.app](https://railway.app) combined with SST for an extremely cheap deployment solution (max ~$15/month, don't take my word for it)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are used to connect [Google authentication](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google) to your app
- `AUTH_SECRET` is the secret key for your authentication
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` allows authentication to work on a local build where only HTTPS is allowed
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` are used to connect to [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is used in development and production
  - When used in development, copy the secret printed when the server runs and paste it into your `.env` file
  ```
  [stripe] Ready! You are using Stripe API Version [2024-11-20.acacia]. Your webhook signing secret is <KEY> (^C to quit)
  ```
  - When used in production, setup a [new webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard/webhooks) with the `invoice.payment_succeeded` and `checkout.session.completed` events
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` are used with SST for [AWS authentication with IAM Identity Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KhrGFV_Npw)
  - After following this tutorial, you want to go to __IAM -> Users__ and create a new user
  - Choose __Attach policies directly__ and select `AdministratorAccess` and create the user
  - Select the user in the table and go to __Security Credentials__ and create a __access key__ with the __other__ option selected
  - You can now paste those credentials inside your `.env` file

### Run the development server
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, Prisma Studio and the Stripe Webhook process
3. Run `sst dev` to start the development server on AWS to test SST components locally (you won't need this if you are only using SST for deployment and not changing internal components)
